# NRT
National Rotor Testbed design documentation for the scaled wake turbine at the Sandia/DOE SWiFT Facility.

# Why was the NRT Designed?
- To conduct wind turbine wake research relevant to megawatt scale turbines
- To be an open, well documented wind turbine blade design for model validation
- To demonstrate new blade technology

# Aeroelastic Model of the NRT Blades, drivetrain, tower
Simple controller model, tuned to match region 2 performance
Please contact us for Advanced simulink model of controller to be
