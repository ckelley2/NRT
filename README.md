# NRT
National Rotor Testbed design documentation at the Sandia/DOE SWiFT Facility, Lubbock, Texas.

#  NRT Designed?
- To conduct wind turbine wake research relevant to megawatt scale turbines
- To be an open, well-documented, and highly instrumented wind turbine blade design for model validation
- To demonstrate new blade technology

# Aeroelastic Model of the NRT Blades, drivetrain, tower
- Simple controller model, tuned to match region 2 performance  
- Modelled in [FAST version 7](https://www.nrel.gov/wind/nwtc/fastv7.html)
- Please contact us for Advanced simulink model of turbine controller

# Blade Instrumentation
- Strain gages at 4 spanwise locations, calibrated to measure aerodynamic bending moment
- Accelerometers at 2 spanwise locations
- Temperature at 4 spanwise locations, to compensate for thermal strain

# Blade Properties
- Length 13 m
- Mass 

# Regions of Operation
- Region 2,  3--8 m/s, 12--3x rpm, TSR = 9
- Region 2.5, 8--11 m/s, 3x--43.9 rpm
- Region 3, 11-20 m/s, 43.9 rpm

# Aerodynamic Design
- Same axial induction as GE 1.5sle for region 2 operation
- S814 airfoil at maximum chord
- S825 across outer 50% of rotor span
- Airfoils operate at a lift coefficient of 0.6 in region 2
